 ## Introduction

Scramjet Sequences don't require high hardware requirements. You can run it also on cheap single-board computers for example Raspberry Pi <img width="1.2%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81818614/219020422-56b87af7-fb08-4de3-9a92-b95c550fc834.svg"> The following configuration was tested on Raspberry Pi ZeroÂ 2Â W booted in headless mode with 64-bit image (5.15 kernel). In this example we will capture some internal parameters of RPi in real time.

## Installation :clamp:

First You should install node.js (we recommend 16.x):
```
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
```
```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
then install our STH and CLI:

```
sudo npm i -g @scramjet/sth @scramjet/cli
```

Verify installation:
```
node -v
si -v
```

## Start STH :checkered_flag:

Create sth_rpi_config.json:
```
{
    "runtimeAdapter": "process",
    "safeOperationLimit": 128,
    "instanceRequirements": { "freeMem": 64 }
}
```
**or** sth_rpi_config.yml:
```
safeOperationLimit: 128
runtimeAdapter: process
instanceRequirements:
    freeMem: 64
```

and launch Scramjet Transform Hub 
```
sth --config /path/to/config/sth_rpi_config.json
```
:bulb: Note: As default hub reserves 512MB of RAM, if your raspberry has 1GB or more, you can try run sth without custom memory limits


## Set up the server and provider

clone this git repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:scramjetorg/raspberry-pi-dash.git
```
Start by personalizing the code to your device:
```bash

cd rpi/ser-seq/client/src/ 
```
In the directory provided, find the "App.js" file and change the websocket's ip address to that of your device.

# Server

Install dependencies and build a static folder for server:

```bash
cd rpi/ser-seq/client/

npm install             # install dependencies

npm run build           # build static folder

cd rpi/ser-seq/

npm install             # install dependencies

```

You can deploy a hosting sequence :rocket: :

```bash
si seq deploy ser-seq   # Be sure to execute this command while being in a directory that contains the "ser-seq" folder
```
If launched correctly, the transfom hub terminal will display the message "Listening on port 3000"

# Provider

Enter the directory of the parameter-reading sequence:

```bash
cd rpi/rpi-seq

npm run build           # build sequence
```
and deploy the sequence! :rocket: :

```bash
si seq deploy dist
```
now the Instance of your Sequence is running and producing to "pi" topic, you can verify that by launching topic listener :ear: via CLI:

```bash
si topic get pi
```
you should see similar output:
```
[38.63, 8.35, 0.25]
[39.17, 8.35, 0.24]
[38.63, 8.35, 0.24]
[38.63, 8.35, 0.24]
```
these values are respectively: chip temperature in Celcius degrees, disk usage and average CPU load.

:bulb: Note: If you want to dig in, there is [full STH documentation](https://github.com/scramjetorg/platform-docs)

# Testing

Now you can monitor the parameters of your device by connecting in your browser to its address.

## FAQ Troubleshooting :collision:
### Why my computer doesn't see the Raspberry?

Raspberry Team have removed default user. If you created image with non official imager (eg. balenaEtcher), you need to create userconf.txt (in the boot root directory) and add the following line:
```
pi:$6$/XOZsG1X0IAbhXB0$wYZHRkvib0SUKQA3KVAxofPR.JsFAbI2NCue2znGvhRsQobVdllFXyQZ7fMSvAoyEj8MfHtkMeSZT7IRIixg01

```
this step will enable default user (user: pi, password: raspberry).

:bulb: We recommend using the official imager


### I made some changes in my code, how to rebuild the sequence?

There are two ways, you can force rebuild with `npm run build --upgrade` or manually remove `/dist` directory and do simple `npm run build`.

## Dictionary :book:

- STH - Scramjet Transform Hub
- Sequence - program adapted to run in STH environment
- Instance - running Sequence
- Topics - are named buses over which Instances exchange messages
- si - Scramjet Command Line Interface
